h1. Algorithms

1. knni : item based knn
2. knnu : user based knn
3. knnui : hybrid item-user based knn
4. knni-all : item based knn with language and reponame information
5. knnu-all : user based knn with language and reponame information
7. repos : using collaborator data (downloaded by github API)
8. bagging : blending different algos

9. In bagging/main.cpp, there are many pre-processing methods used
1) diversity : we find it is very hard to predict recommendations for users who watches a lot of repos. So, making diversity recommendations can improve prodiction accuracy of these users.
2) popularity : if a users does not view popular repos before, it means he may not like popular repos, so, we can delete popular repos in recommendation list.
